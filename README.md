# Node Express EJS Templates

Here's a simple sample project that shows off how to set up a static directory,
serve a CSS file, use an EJS template and use some fancy embedded JavaScript in
the template.

## Project Setup

Install all of the project dependencies with `npm install`. The dependencies are
stored inside the `package.json` file that's created when someone runs `npm init`.

Run the server with `nodemon index.js`.
